<h2>8<sup>th</sup> May 2020</h2>
<p>My acquaintance's website is finished, and should be published soon. You will be able to see a comparison shortly. That is not really a lot to talk about.</p>
<p>I have set up the index for my archive section. Looking through those documents brought up a lot of old memories (if something 9 months ago can even qualify as old). Looking at the first editions 
of my website, I remember the level of web development languages I knew: Virtually no HTML, and literally no JavaScript and CSS. I had this certain cockiness back then, I honestly admired my 
sort of pathetic website back then. I've also realised that less than 3 months after the creation of my website, I learned enough JavaScript and CSS to launch a complete revision of my website, and even make some games 
Yes, I've come a long way from then. <i>*Sniff sniff*, super clich√©d emotional moment...</i> Anyway... where was I? Eh, never mind.</p>
<p>Goodbye from United Geekdom.</p>

<h2>3<sup>rd</sup> May 2020</h2>
I did not write a blog post yesterday for lack of topic. This blog post should be relatively short for the same reason.
<h4><b>My recent works</b></h4>
<dl>
<dt>My acquaintance's website</dt>
<dd>I am still working on my acquaintance's website. In fact, it is nearly done. It turns out that a major part in modernizing a web page is just using a modern-looking font. For this, I turned to <a href="https://fonts.google.com" >Google Fonts</a>.</dd>
<dt>Archives</dt>
<dd>I recently discovered a feature on my <a href="https://github.com/united-geekdom">GitHub page</a> which allowed me to access an archive of all my contributions to my website. From this, I have decided to create an archive of my website, detailing every single day. These pages have been completely unchanged, apart from the <code>href</code> and <code>src</code> attributes (links). I will not link to the archives from the homepage until I develop a portal to access the archived pages, but you can access the first page <a href="../../../archive/2019/08/03/" >here.</a> </dd>
</dl>
<br>I have realised that these pages are more like journals than blogs. However, it would be too tedious to change it at this point.
<br>Goodbye from United Geekdom.

<h2>1<sup>st</sup> May 2020</h2>
This is the first blog post of a new month. I had not written a blog post for 3 days as I had pretty much nothing to write on. I had to reform the calendar system to help link to different months.
 I also started a folder system to organize blog pages by month and year.
<br>
Apart from the reform of this blog post, I have been quite busy today. I created a navigational bar generator demo for <a href="https://htmlwriter.github.io" >HTML writer</a>. You can view the
demo <a href="../../../tests/topnav.html">here</a>, but there is a glitch in the JavaScript which renders variables set in other functions as undefined. If you have the solution to this, please send me
 a comment <a href="/">here</a>.
<br>I have also made a music video on scratch for a song which I have shared in a previous blog post. It can be found below. I found that the timing between the beats of our song aligned perfectly with 
25<sup>th</sup>s of seconds, making it far easier for the animated drummer to align perfectly with the drums of the song. If it lags, click the flag again.<br>

<br>
I have also been working on an acquaintance's website. I will link to it once I'm done, along with a before and after frameset so that you can see the difference.
<br>Goodbye from United Geekdom.
