<h2>27<sup>th</sup> April 2020</h2>
Today, I made a search engine for my website. That's not exactly true: I had originally made it for <a href="https://randomsite.github.io" >RandomSite</a>, and then copied it into my own site, but it's
close enough. I have not made any major changes to my blog today.
<br>I have been making music with <a href="https://keshuook.github.io" >keshuook</a>. I play the drums, and he does the guitar and vocals. Here are two songs that we have made together, for a Scratch movie
called "Robots' revenge":
<br><audio controls>
  <source src="../../../no_hellwav.wav" type="audio/wav">
Your web browser does not support the audio player.
</audio>
<audio controls>
<br><source src="../../../allhailmightyrobots.wav" type="audio/wav">
</audio>
<br>As you can see, I am not that great at the drums, but it's good enough for a scratch audience.
I have discontinued the CHARnimation movie, and am working more on the aforementioned <a href="https://htmlwriter.github.io">HTMLwriter</a>, and have decided to start a maths section with a couple of
year-old unreleased projects. Here is a generator for the number <i>e</i>, which is generated from the formula [1 + <sup>1</sup>/<sub><i>n</i></sub>]<sup><i>n</i></sup>, where <i>n</i> = infinity. 
This is a generator which creates <i>e</i> for a given value of <i>n</i>. However, this generator seems to break down for especially large inputs of <i>n</i>.
<br>
<input id="numb" type="number">
<button type="button" onclick="e()">Go!</button>
<p id="demo"><br></p>
<script>
function e() {
  var x, y;
  x = document.getElementById("numb").value
  y = ((1 + (1 / x)) ** x) / 10;
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = y * 10;
}
</script>
That is all for now.
<br>Goodbye from United Geekdom.
<i>PS: Can anyone show me how to fix the problem where the audio players scroll over the fixed div? Please <a href="../../../" >leave a comment</a> if you know how to fix it.</i>

<h2>26<sup>th</sup> April 2020</h2>
I was not particularly productive on the web today. I managed to add a dark mode to the blog, but I haven't made any progress on my CHARnimation movie. I am working on a pixel art editor with a save code
generator on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/randomsite" >RandomSite's Scratch account</a>, and I'm also working on a CSS code generator at the <a href="https://htmlwriter.github.io" >HTML writer
website</a>. I have also redesigned my homepage, and removed the now redundant Updates and Notice Board sections.
<br>
In the process of making this blog, I have learned some nifty tricks, mainly in JavaScript and CSS. I use <a href="https://w3schools.com" >W3 schools</a> for most of my reference code, but where it fails, I use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> instead.
Most of these tricks actually use a combination of CSS and JavaScript. Below is the code used to make a basic dark mode.
<br>The JS:
<pre>
// Use a button to start the function.
function darkMode() {
   var element = document.body;
   element.classList.toggle("dark-mode");
}
</pre>
<br>The CSS:
<pre>
body {
  color: black;
  background-color: white;
}

.dark-mode {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}
</pre>
Add more elements to the dark mode by using .dark mode + element. For example, .darkmode h1{color: white;} 

<br> I'll include some more coding tricks in tomorrow's blog post.
<br>For a preview of my CSS code generator, go <a href="https://htmlwriter.github.io/tests/css.html">here</a> for the latest functioning version, or <a href="../../
../tests/css.html" >here</a> for the version
still in progress. This is all the work I have done today, and will have to pick up the pace tomorrow.

<h2>25<sup>th</sup> April 2020</h2>
This is my first blog post. Spent a good part of the day designing the blog. This blog is basically an update indicator for the website, as well as a journal for all my web affairs.
I will not be including anything personal in this.<br>
<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/knitt" >My account</a> was blocked from scratch 3 days ago on the 21<sup>st</sup> of March, for giving my e-mail to a Scratcher: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/mallikaook" >mallikaook</a>, even though I already knew
her. During that, I started working on the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/randomsite" >Scratch account</a> for <a href="https://randomsite.github.io" >RandomSite</a>. I had spent a lot of the lockdown
developing that website, when I realized that I had not yet begun to further develop my own website. I still have a long length of lockdown ahead of me: the Coronavirus pandemic does not seem to be slowing down soon,
so I decided to make a movie completely out of text, like my <a href="../../../charnimation" >CHARnimations</a>. It would be imaginatively titled: "CHARnimation: the movie". After a couple of days however, my
progress was tedious, and I decided to make a blog instead. My movie is still in progress, and should be done by the end of the summer vacation/lockdown. I also remade a song with my friend 
<a href="https://keshuook.github.io" >keshuook</a>, and will be posting it on my scratch page, and possibly this website soon. Aside from the web, I am reading some classics. I am also reading some economics books.
I got a shortwave radio recently, and used to spend some time listening to the news, but it has just gotten too depressing now. I have a lot to do on this site, and will be sure to see you tomorrow.
<br>Goodbye from United Geekdom.
