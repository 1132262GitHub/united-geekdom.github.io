<h2> Poetry </h2>
<br>
<p> I am a huge fan of poetry. I write, frankly, terrible poems, and am very glad to be sharing them with my audience here, tiny as said audience may be. A poem will be added everyday.
 This page is for today's poem. For those of you who are confused by the arrows, the double arrow to the left mens the first poem, while the double arrow to the right means the current poem.
The arrow to the left means the previous poem, the arrow to the right means the next poem.</p>

<h3>Independence special</h3>
<pre>
They're isolated, what a thing!
They must be an estranged tribe to sing.
Not a tribal chant,
Which our culture does grant,
But their anthem's 'God Save the King'!
</pre>

<i>(Happy Indian Independence Day from</i> United Geekdom <i>. 72 years since we've had to sing this song!)</i>
