<h3> Welcome the home page of this website!</h3>
<p>If you're wondering how this is geeky, the very fact that I've written this page with HTML should be. The fact that it's being hosted on GitHub comes as an added bonus.</p>
<p>I have just started this website, so it's practically threadbare. More content will be coming out, over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>For now, all this home page features is this thing I created on a drawing program, so here it is.</p>

On this day, I reformed the navigational system of my poems section to use buttons instead of plain-text links. I had not, in fact, updated my poems section for a long time 
(I was too busy with schoolwork, and too lazy, I guess.) I didn't update it on this day either. While it wasn't as advanced as the
<a href="https://pencilpublishers.github.io/poems"> navigational system used now</a>, I was still proud of it, and I don't think it was too bad now, looking back on it.
