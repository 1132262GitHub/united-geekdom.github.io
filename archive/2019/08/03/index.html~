<h3> Welcome the home page of this website!</h3>
<p>For now, the only page this website features is this useless home page, and the poetry page.</p>
<p>For now, all this home page features is this thing I created on a drawing program, so here it is.</p>

As explained in the <a href="../../../insertgenericwebsitenamehere">page for my previous website</a>, this website used to be called the generic website, and was built on Serveo, before it became too
difficult to maintain the servers, and I shifted it here. Apart from the name and domain change, it may seem like the first version of this website in indistinguishable from the previous one, and indeed it is.
However, the name and domain change in itself set a change of pace for this website. In the previous one, I had not even thought about picking up the languages such as JavaScript and CSS, which made this
 website what it is now. In fact, I was not even really serious about the website, and had meant for it to be mostly dormant. However, with a change of environment, one where there is a larger community 
 and greater social interaction, such as the ability to commit to other projects, I was more encouraged to take the website further, and can now create pages which wouldn't have been palpable in my 
 previous website.
