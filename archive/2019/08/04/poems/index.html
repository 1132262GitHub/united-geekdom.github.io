<h2> Poetry </h2>
<br>
<p> I am a huge fan of poetry. I write, frankly, terrible poems, and am very glad to be sharing them with my audience here, tiny as said audience may be. A poem will be added everyday.
 This page is for today's poem.</p>

<h3>Pollution</h3>
<pre>
The kids all cried 'what do we do?!'
When the factory smoke killed all the Flew.
'When it was the birds, we cheered:
"No more dropped turds!",
But now it's killed Superman too!'
