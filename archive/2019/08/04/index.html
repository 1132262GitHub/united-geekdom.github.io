<h3> Welcome the home page of this website!</h3>
<p>If you're wondering how this is geeky, the very fact that I've written this page with HTML should be. The fact that It's being hosted on GitHub comes as an added bonus.</p>
<p>For now, all this home page features is this thing I created on a drawing program, so here it is.</p>

With this version of the website comes the introduction of the 2020 calendar, whose notes are currently being written well into 2020, and in the middle of a worldwide coronavirus pandemic. This calendar 
is notoriously difficult to edit, as it has twelve pages, all of which require editing at the same time :P. I also attempted to set up a really terrible navigational system for the poems section, using
symbols made from characters (<, <<, >, >>), and the <code>&lta href=""&gt</code> tag. This would be rectified twice, the second time making it the current system. The poems can now be found
