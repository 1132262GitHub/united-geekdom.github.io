<h2> Poetry </h2>
<br>
<p> I am a huge fan of poetry. I write, frankly, terrible poems, and am very glad to be sharing them with my audience here, tiny as said audience may be. A poem will be added everyday.
 This page is for today's poem. For those of you who are confused by the arrows, the double arrow to the left mens the first poem, while the double arrow to the right means the current poem.
The arrow to the left means the previous poem, the arrow to the right means the next poem.</p>

<h3>Pollution</h3>
<pre>
'My prospects look good', I told a friend,
And realising what I said,
Knocked thrice on a branch, which swung
And hit me on the head

Then, a black cat started to cross my path.
I stopped and turned around.
As I walked a truck came along, 
and ran me to the ground.

My hospitable bed was a dozen plus one,
So I shifted to number fourteen.
But the entire ward caught fire;
The only survivor was bed 13.

As I neared the heavens, I asked:
'Why'd you give me this agony?'
They said 'Stars may give you luck,
But we give you irony.'
