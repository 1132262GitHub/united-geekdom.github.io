<h3> Welcome the home page of this website!</h3>
<p>If you're wondering how this is geeky, the very fact that I've written this page with HTML should be. The fact that It's being hosted on GitHub comes as an added bonus.</p>
<p>For now, all this home page features is this thing I created on a drawing program, so here it is.</p>
