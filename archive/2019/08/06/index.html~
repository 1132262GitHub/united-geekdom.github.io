<h3> Welcome the home page of this website!</h3>
<p>If you're wondering how this is geeky, the very fact that I've written this page with HTML should be. The fact that it's being hosted on GitHub comes as an added bonus.</p>
<p>I have just started this website, so it's practically threadbare. More content will be coming out, over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>For now, all this home page features is this thing I created on a drawing program, so here it is.</p>

As explained in the <a href="../../../insertgenericwebsitenamehere">page for my previous website</a>, this website used to be called the generic website, and was built on Serveo, before it became too
difficult to maintain the servers, and I shifted it here. Apart from the name and domain change, it may seem like the first version of this website is indistinguishable from the previous one, and indeed it is.
However, the name and domain change in itself set a change of pace for this website. In the previous one, I had not even thought about picking up the languages such as JavaScript and CSS, which made this
 website what it is now. In fact, I was not even really serious about the website, and had meant for it to be mostly dormant. However, with a change of environment, one where there is a larger community 
 and greater social interaction, such as the ability to commit to other projects, I was more encouraged to take the website further, and can now create pages which wouldn't have been palpable in my 
 previous website.
