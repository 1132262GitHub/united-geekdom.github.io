<h3> Welcome the home page of this website!</h3>
<p>If you're wondering how this is geeky, the very fact that I've written this page with HTML should be. The fact that it's being hosted on GitHub comes as an added bonus.</p>
<p>I have just started this website, so it's practically threadbare. More content will be coming out, over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>For now, all this home page features is this thing I created on a drawing program, so here it is.</p>

With this version of the website came an attempt to change the navigational system of my poems section, using images of arrows. The plan backfired horribly. Since I decided only to change the links in 
archived pages, and to add these authour's notes, I was only able to restore the navigational system to some extent. It failed mostly due to the size of the images I used as arrows. Nothing else changed 
in this version of the website.
