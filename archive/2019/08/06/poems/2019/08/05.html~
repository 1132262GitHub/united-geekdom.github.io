<h3>The worst limit is the sky</h3>
<pre>
'My prospects look good', I told a friend,
And realising what I said,
Knocked thrice on a branch, which swung
And hit me on the head

Then, a black cat started to cross my path.
I stopped and turned around.
As I walked a truck came along, 
and ran me to the ground.

My hospitable bed was a dozen plus one,
So I shifted to number fourteen.
But the entire ward caught fire;
The only survivor was bed 13.

As I neared the heavens, I asked:
'Why'd you give me this agony?'
They said 'Stars may give you luck,
But we give you irony.'
