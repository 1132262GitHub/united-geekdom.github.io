<h3> Welcome the home page of this website!</h3>
<p>If you're wondering how this is geeky, the very fact that I've written this page with HTML should be. The fact that it's being hosted on GitHub comes as an added bonus.</p>
<p>I have just started this website, so it's practically threadbare. More content will be coming out, over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>For now, all this home page features is this thing I created on a drawing program, so here it is.</p>

This was the day I added the games section to my website. It consisted of only one page, and something like three games. Given that I didn't know JavaScript then, they were all made with 
<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>. You can find more <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/knitt/">here</a>. It would still be a while before I added my first JavaScript game to this website.
