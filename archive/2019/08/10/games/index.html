All my games are programmed using scratch. Here are a few of my games.

<h3>Alien escape</h3>
<br>
<p>You, the scratch cat have been abducted by aliens. You are making your great escape through a vortex, and it will take one minute to finish it.
 But, the vortex is guarded. Whenever you see a robot guard, you must shoot him in 0.3 seconds, before you lose a life.
 As a cat, you only have nine lives, so be careful. Press f to shoot.</p>

<h3>Flying cat</h3>
<p>You will control a flying scratch cat. Type in fly to start the game. You should use the up and down arrow keys to move up and down.
Don't touch purple. Green flag to restart. Credit to The Who for their song, "I can't explain".</p>
