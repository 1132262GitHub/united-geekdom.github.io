<h2> Poetry </h2>
<br>
<p> I am a huge fan of poetry. I write, frankly, terrible poems, and am very glad to be sharing them with my audience here, tiny as said audience may be. A poem will be added everyday.
 This page is for today's poem. For those of you who are confused by the arrows, the double arrow to the left mens the first poem, while the double arrow to the right means the current poem.
The arrow to the left means the previous poem, the arrow to the right means the next poem.</p>

<h3>Superman's mistake</h3>
<pre>
We shouldn't have taken the flash to the bar.
Who knew that his speed would extend so very far?
In 5 seconds flat
He's a raving bat!
No, we shouldn't have taken him to the bar.
