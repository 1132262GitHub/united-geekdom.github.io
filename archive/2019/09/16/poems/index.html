<h2> Poetry </h2>
<br>
<p> I am a huge fan of poetry. I write, frankly, terrible poems, and am very glad to be sharing them with my audience here, tiny as said audience may be. A poem will be added everyday.
 This page is for today's poem. For those of you who are confused by the arrows, the double arrow to the left mens the first poem, while the double arrow to the right means the current poem.
The arrow to the left means the previous poem, the arrow to the right means the next poem.</p>

<h3>Ode to myself</h3>
<pre>
The once was a poet
Who, didn't he know it!
Wrote some nauseating trite.
The best of his prose
Was kicked out of his doors
And the rest landed on his website.
