<h3> Welcome the the home page of this generic website!</h3>
<p>For now, the only page this website features is this useless home page, and the limericks page, which is not far off from uselessness.</p>
<p>For now, all this home page features is this thing i created on a drawing program, so here it is.</p>

So I had actually created this website on the 27<sup>th</sup> of July 2019, one week before it was moved to GitHub. I just called it the generic website, and it was created using <a href="https://serveo.net">Serveo</a>
It was just created as my friend created their website, RandomWebsite (later to become RandomSite), also using Serveo. However, Serveo required an installation of a server, and the server was an absolute
pain to maintain (hey, that rhymed!). I had to keep my computer running 24/7, or else my website wouldn't work. So one week later I made the switch to GitHub, as it seemed much easier to use and I was already familiar.
A couple of days later, my friend made the same move for <a href="https://randomsite.github.io">RandomSite</a>. I was also not proud of the name which I had bestowed upon my website, so I dubbed my new website
United Geekdom, which, for reasons unbeknownst to myself or anyone I know, I am much prouder of. This also, interestingly, features a poem which was later removed. Of course, in a couple of months the 
entire poems section would be removed and relocated to <a href="https://pencilpublishers.github.io/poems/">Pencil Publishers</a>. <br>
