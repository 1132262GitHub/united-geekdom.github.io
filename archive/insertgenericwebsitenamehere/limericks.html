<h1> Limericks </h1>
<br>
<p> I am a huge fan of limericks. I write, frankly, terrible limericks, and am very glad to be sharing them with my audience here, tiny as said audience may be. Scroll down for today's
limericks, and further still for the rest of them. A limerick will be added everyday.</p>

<h3>The salmon, insured</h3>
Fred the salmon had his life insured
<br>
Though his friends thought insurance was fraud.
<br>
But when he was fished
<br>
and his breathing was wished
<br>
He was taken away, and cured!
<br>
<br>
<h3>The Ivor's</h3>
There once was a group called the Ivor's
<br>
In whose tale there are no survivors.
<br>
They drowned to their ends
<br>
with their brothers and friends
<br>
in a pool-they were synchronised divers!
