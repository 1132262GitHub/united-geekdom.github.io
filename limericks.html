<h1> Poetry </h1>
<br>
<p> I am a huge fan of poetry. I write, frankly, terrible poems, and am very glad to be sharing them with my audience here, tiny as said audience may be. A poem will be added everyday.
 This page is for today's poem.</p>

<h3>The salmon, insured</h3>
Fred the salmon had his life insured
<br>
Though his friends thought insurance was fraud.
<br>
But when he was fished
<br>
And his breathing was wished
<br>
He was taken away, and cured!
